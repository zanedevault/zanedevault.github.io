## Deleting unused `node_module` directories

`npx npkill` is a helpful tool specifically designed for this purpose.

This will launch an interactive interface that:

- Scans your system for node_modules folders
- Shows the size of each folder
- Lets you navigate with arrow keys and delete with spacebar
- Shows potential space savings
- Helps you avoid accidentally deleting active project dependencies
