# Testing

## General Notes

**React Testing Library** - provides a simulated DOM so the tests can interact with this simulated DOM and it can be inspected to see if the app is behaving as expected

**Vitest (or Jest)** - is a test runner (finds, runs and determines pass/fail)

---

**3 Parts of a Test**

- **A**rrange - set up the test conditions
- **A**ct - run the logic that should be tested (this part is optional if checking the existence of a component)
- **A**ssert - compare actual and expected results
