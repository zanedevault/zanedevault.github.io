## _(61.5 hrs)_ - Dr. Angela Yu

- **VIDEOS THAT WOULD BE GOOD TO REVIEW:** _the rest of the videos can safely be ignored_

- Section 9: Flexbox - this entire section would be good to review for a deeper understanding of flexbox, she explains details in a very helpful way.
- Section 15: Intermediate Javascript
  - [Random Number Generation in Javascript: Building a Love Calculator (vid 99)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12373892#overview) - this has an awesome explanation of using `Math.random()`
- Section 18: Advanced JavaScript and DOM Manipulation
  - [Higher Order Functions and Passing Functions as Arguments (vid 137)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12383962#overview) - this includes a demonstration of using the Chrome debugger
  - [Objects, their Methods and the Dot Notation (vid 142)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12384070#overview) - this includes a good explanation of `constructor` functions in JS
  - [Understanding Callbacks and How to Respond to Events (vid 145)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12384168#overview) - another good explanation, this time for callback functions
- Section 20: Boss Level Chalenge 2 - The Simon Game - This would be a good section to go through when I want a logic/planning challenge. I wouldn't review this for the jQuery but more for the structuring code / refactoring practice. I think it would be good to just start with the starting files and look at the final game example and try to recreate it from that point. I would probably need to create it then really refactor the code to go from a procedural pattern to a functional / object oriented pattern.
- Section 21: The Unix Command Line
  - [Command Line Techniques and Directory Navigation](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12384404#overview) - This has some cool command line shortcuts
